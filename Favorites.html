			<p>Demon Slayer was the anime that got me into anime and therefore will always hold a special place for me.</p><br>
			<p>This anime has some of the best fight scenes I have ever seen along with such strong character connection.<br>
				The love you can form for a character in such a short amount of time shows how good the character development and writing is.</p><br>
			<p>The entire story of Demon Slayer always kept me entertained. From the Hashiras, to the ranked demons, to Nezuko proving
				you are not the stereotype you are labaled as makes Demon Slayer my favorite anime I have seen so far.</p>

			<p>My Hero Academia is the longest anime I have watched so far but I was always excited for the next season.</p><br>
			<p>Even though the idea of powers and watching someone learn to use their powers has been done before, something about the way MHA did it was always entertaining. Seeing so many people learn their powers at once with many of them even learning additional powers was always exciting and something to look forward to.</p><br>
			<p>The selflessness of many of the characters was always refreshing especially when it came from unexpected characters.</p>

			<p>The Promised Neverland was an anime I was not so sure I would like at first and it started off slow but as soon ad the big plot reveal hit, I was hooked.</p><br>
			<p>Once the action started and the main plot was revealed everywhere I looked there was a new plot twist.</p><br>
			<p>It felt as if I never know who would die because most characters have "plot armor" in animes but in this one I was never confident.</p><br>
			<p>Everyone loves a story of unlikely allies and that is one of many things this anime brings to its viewers.</p>
